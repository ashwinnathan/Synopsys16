A Structured Segmented Mutation Method To Increase The Efficiency of Genetic Algorithms 

Won 2nd Place Category Award and Honorable Mention Association for Computing Machinery

Overview
Genetic algorithms are a type of heuristic method used in solving optimization problems. The algorithm is modeled after the biological process of natural selection, in which the most fit solution from each generation continues on to the next, and better solutions are acquired through random mutations and crossover. One of the problems with such an algorithm is that as the number of elements that need to be processed increases, there is an exponential in increase in the search space size. My project focuses on increasing the efficiency of genetic algorithms by creating a structured mutation method.
